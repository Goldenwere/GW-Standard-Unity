This repo is currently being restructured, and several packages deprecated.

Packages Deprecated:
- Slider extensions and other UI extensions: deprecated in favor of a better unified package
- DeveloperCamera aka FreeFlyCamera: deprecated for its simplicity, will simply be an isolated asset for copy-pasting into a package
- Demos: now are Samples/Demo per package rather than their own individual packages

Packages Changed:
- FirstPersonController 1.x -> CharacterController 2.x
- ManagementCam 1.x -> SimuCam 2.x

Packages Unchanged:
- Tooltips
