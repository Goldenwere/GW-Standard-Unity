# Goldenwere Cross-Project Unity Code

## About

This repo contains code that is intended to be used across multiple projects. It is kept as independent as possible so that it can work even outside Goldenwere Unity projects.

## Code

All code falls within children of the Goldenwere.Unity namespace. Some classes may require this repo's CoreAPI. The code styling originates from [Unknown Entity 2](https://github.com/Goldenwere/UE2_Source/wiki)'s source guidelines. See the [wiki](https://github.com/Goldenwere/GW-Standard-Unity/wiki) for an explanation of the function/purpose of each class. Code features XML comments to explain methods and usage further.
