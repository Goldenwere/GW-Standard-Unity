# Goldenwere Standard Unity Repository

## About

The Goldenwere Standard Unity Repository (GW-Std-Unity) is a collection of free-and-open-source (FOSS) assets for use in developing within the Unity engine. GW-Std-Unity is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md) (note: demo packages may include third party assets not licensed under MIT; their respective licenses will be included in both the repo and in asset packages).

## Purpose

GW-Std-Unity was created in order to make independent, re-usable cross-project assets for use in game development with Unity. As such, most assets contain a variety of features to allow for greatest usage.
